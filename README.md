###### This project is an assignment that I completed for my Object-Oriented Programming in Java class at Langara.

## JavaFXLayout

- In this project, I have used JavaFX to create an application and utilize mouse events.

Here we have a background (grass), a tree, a smiley and a rainbow.
1. User can choose to show/hide both the smiley and the rainbow.
2. User can also choose to rotate the tree using given rotation options.
3. Lastly, user can add text to the stage.

User can close the window using the red window button or by pressing the <code>close</code> button.
